```bash
# Using daemon API
hyperctl migrate

# Using direct vCenter connection
export GOVC_URL='https://vcenter.example.com/sdk'
export GOVC_USERNAME='administrator@vsphere.local'
export GOVC_PASSWORD='your-password'
export GOVC_INSECURE=1
hyperctl migrate
```

## Navigation Controls

### Basic Movement

- **↑ / k** - Move cursor up
- **↓ / j** - Move cursor down
- **Space** - Select/deselect current VM
- **Enter** - Proceed to next step
- **Esc / b** - Go back to previous step
- **q** - Quit

The interface automatically displays a scrolling window when you have more VMs than can fit on screen. The cursor stays centered as you navigate through long lists.

## Search and Filter

### Search (`/` key)

Press `/` to enter search mode. Search is **case-insensitive** and matches against:

- VM name
- VM path
- Guest OS type

**Example searches:**
- `ubuntu` - Finds all VMs with "ubuntu" in name, path, or OS
- `web-server` - Finds VMs with "web-server" in their name
- `windows` - Finds all Windows VMs

**Search controls:**
- Type to search
- **Backspace** - Delete last character
- **Enter** - Apply search and return to VM list
- **Esc** - Cancel search

The search provides **live preview** showing:
- Number of matching VMs
- First 10 matching VMs
- Count of additional matches

### Power State Filter (`f` key)

Press `f` repeatedly to cycle through power state filters:

1. **All VMs** (no filter)
2. **Powered ON only** - Shows only running VMs
3. **Powered OFF only** - Shows only stopped VMs

Current filter is shown in the status bar.

### Clear Filters (`c` key)

Press `c` to clear all active filters and searches at once, returning to the full VM list.

## Sorting

Press `s` to cycle through sort modes:

1. **Name** (A-Z) - Alphabetical by VM name
2. **CPU** - By CPU count (highest first)
3. **Memory** - By memory allocation (highest first)
4. **Storage** - By storage size (largest first)
5. **Power** - Powered ON VMs first, then powered OFF

Current sort mode is displayed in the help text.

**Performance note:** Sorting uses efficient O(n log n) algorithms and is instant even with 1000+ VMs.

- **Rendering:** Shows 20 VMs at a time, scrolls smoothly

## Troubleshooting

### "No VMs found"

**Check:**
1. Daemon is running: `sudo systemctl status hyper2kvmd`
2. vCenter credentials are correct
3. Environment variables are set (for direct connection)
4. Your user has permission to list VMs

### Search returns no results

**Try:**
1. Clear filters with `c`
2. Check search term spelling
3. Search is case-insensitive, but spelling must match
4. Try searching by path or OS instead of name

### VMs not visible after filtering

**Solution:**
- Press `c` to clear all filters
- VMs may be filtered out by power state or search

### Can't select VMs

**Ensure:**
- You're in selection mode (not search or detail view)
- Press **Esc** if you're in another mode
- Use **Space** on the VM under the cursor

## Best Practices

1. **Start with search/filter** - Narrow down before bulk operations
2. **Use detail view** - Verify specs before migration
3. **Test with dry-run** - Always preview first for critical migrations
4. **Sort strategically** - Use CPU/memory sort to group similar VMs
5. **Select incrementally** - Filter → select → filter again → select more
6. **Use systemd service** - For any migration longer than 30 minutes

## Advanced Workflows

### Batch Migration Strategy

1. **Group by size:** Sort by storage
2. **Migrate small first:** Select bottom 10 VMs
3. **Test migration:** Run in terminal mode
4. **If successful:** Migrate larger batches via systemd service

### Staged Migration

1. **Day 1:** Filter powered OFF, migrate all
2. **Day 2:** Filter by development environment, migrate
3. **Day 3:** Filter by production, schedule maintenance window
4. **Migrate:** Use systemd service for production VMs

### Selective Migration

```bash
# Find all database servers
Press / → type "mysql" OR "postgres" OR "mongodb"

# Review each
Press d on each VM to inspect

# Select only production
Space on each production DB server

# Dry-run to verify
Press r → Enter → review → Esc

# Execute
Press r → Enter → y
```
